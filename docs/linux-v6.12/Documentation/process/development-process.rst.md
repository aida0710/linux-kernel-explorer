A guide to the Kernel Development Process
=========================================

The purpose of this document is to help developers (and their managers)
work with the development community with a minimum of frustration.  It is
an attempt to document how this community works in a way which is
accessible to those who are not intimately familiar with Linux kernel
development (or, indeed, free software development in general).  While
there is some technical material here, this is very much a process-oriented
discussion which does not require a deep knowledge of kernel programming to
understand.
