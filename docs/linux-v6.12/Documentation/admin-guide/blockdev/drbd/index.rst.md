Distributed Replicated Block Device - DRBD
==========================================

Description
===========

  DRBD is a shared-nothing, synchronously replicated block device. It
  is designed to serve as a building block for high availability
  clusters and in this context, is a "drop-in" replacement for shared
  storage. Simplistically, you could see it as a network RAID 1.

  Please visit https://www.drbd.org to find out more.
