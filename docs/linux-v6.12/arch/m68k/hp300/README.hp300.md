HP300 notes
-----------

The Linux/HP web page is at <http://www.tazenda.demon.co.uk/phil/linux-hp/>

Currently only 9000/340 machines have been tested.  Any amount of RAM should
work now but I've only tried 16MB and 12MB.

The serial console is probably broken at the moment but the Topcat/HIL keyboard
combination seems to work for me.  Your mileage may vary.

The LANCE driver works after a fashion but only if you reset the chip before
every packet.  This doesn't make for very speedy operation.
